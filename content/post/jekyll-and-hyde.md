# Jekyll and Hyde

I've start a new blog using [Jekyll][jekyll] with [Hyde][hyde] theme hosted on [GitHub Pages][github.io]. This is quite an refreshing change from the traditional database-based hosted blog approach I'm used to, such as Blogger or Wordpress.

Such a simple yet powerful way to serve static pages where you are in full control of your content. There has been a slight knowledge curve but it's been a good learning experience so far.
