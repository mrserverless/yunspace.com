[Apmasphere][apmasphere] is an elite team of revolutionaries tackling the old-school property management industry, with fresh new ideas, mobile apps and cloud based infrastrcuture. I had the pleasure of working with them to build a quick prototype using Dropwizard and Mongodb hosted on [Google Compute Engine][gce]. <iframe src='//slides.com/yunzhilin/dropwizard-mongodb/embed' width='576' height='420' scrolling='no' frameborder='0' webkitallowfullscreen='' mozallowfullscreen='' allowfullscreen=''>

It was a very good learning experience since it was my first time playing around with Google Compute Engine, and managed to put in a related [Stack Exchange][stackex] answer based on my steps.

EDIT 2014-12-07: I have made cleaned up the source code for this project and made them available in [github][github].
