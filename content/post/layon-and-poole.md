As per v2.0.0 of this blog I've changed from my theme from [Hyde][andhyde] to [Layon][layon]. Both themes are based on [Poole][poole] (Jekyll's butler), released open source by the very creative [Mark Otto][mdo].

The main difference with Layon is that the sidebar is tucked away neatly, which I prefer for more mobile friendliness.

[mdo]:      http://markdotto.com/
[layon]:    https://github.com/poole/lanyon
[andhyde]:  https://github.com/poole/hyde
