I'm a Sydney-based CTO leading the FinTech Revolution at
[Republic Wealth Management](http://www.republicwealth.com.au). This blog is
aimed at sharing my experiences working in the FinTech, PropTech space.

Being a Microservices and container advocate, I've built this site using an
automated [Docker Microservices stack](/docker-tutum-cloud/) which doesn't
require much maintenance on my behalf.

I am the creator of the following projects:

  * [Harp 2 Hugo gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/harp2hugo)
  * [Dropwizard XML Bundle](https://github.com/yunspace/dropwizard-xml)
  * [Docker Alpine Hugo](https://github.com/yunspace/docker-alpine-hugo)
  * [Docker Alphine Harp](https://github.com/yunspace/docker-alpine-harp)
  * [lazybones-dropwizard-turbo](https://github.com/Trunkplatform/lazybones-dropwizard-turbo)
  * [Tutum Zero Downtime Deploy gem](https://github.com/Trunkplatform/tutum-deploy)

  and actively contributes to the following:

  * [Dropwizard Guice](https://github.com/HubSpot/dropwizard-guice/)
  * [TechEmpower Framework Benchmarks](https://github.com/TechEmpower/FrameworkBenchmarks)
  * [Gwizard](https://github.com/gwizard/gwizard)

Source code and Stack (Docker Compose) for this blog is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/yunspace/yunspace.com).
