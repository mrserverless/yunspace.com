I'm a proud father, lucky husband, man of faith, and passionate technologist from Sydney.

Currently I'm working as Microservices Lead at [amaysim][amaysim-url] and Technical Advisor for [Alchemey Ventures][alchemy-yun] 

- I've been using Docker in production since 2014, across 3 startups and 1 public company. Each time I had to setup the container orchestration platform from scratch.
- I've hobbied with Unity3d since 2009 but have yet to release a game. 
- I picked up GoLang in 2 days mid 2016 and refuses to code in anything else from then on.

This site rans on Rancher Server hoste by Azure. Code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/yunspace/yunspace.com).
