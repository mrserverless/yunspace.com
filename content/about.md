My name is Yun Zhi Lin. I am a proud father, lucky husband, man of faith, and passionate technologist from Sydney.

Currently I am leading Microservices Transformation at [amaysim][amaysim-url] and give Technical Advice to [Alchemey Ventures][alchemy-yun] 

- I've been using Docker in production since 2014, across 3 startups and 1 public company. Each time setting up a brand new container orchestration platform from scratch.
- I've hobbied with Unity3d since 2009 and currently interested in gamified commercial applications. 
- I picked up GoLang in 2 days mid 2016 and refuses to code in anything else from then on.
