I'm a Sydney-based Technologist and Unity developer. Currently I am empowering the
Property Revolution at [TrunkPlatform](http://www.trunkplatform.com) and [Apmasphere](https://http://www.apmasphere.com/)

This blog is built upon an automated [Docker Microservices stack](/docker-tutum-cloud/) which doesn't require much maintenance on my behalf.

I'm passionate about Art, Real Estate, Immersive Entertainment and Cloud Technologies. You can find
my code [here](https://github.com/yunspace), my talks [here](/talks/), and my drawings coming soon.

I am the creator of the following projects:

  * [Harp 2 Hugo gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/harp2hugo)
  * [Dropwizard XML Bundle](https://github.com/yunspace/dropwizard-xml)
  * [Docker Alpine Hugo](https://github.com/TechnoTycoon/docker-alpine-hugo)
  * [Docker Alphine Harp](https://github.com/TechnoTycoon/docker-alpine-harp)
  * [lazybones-dropwizard-turbo](https://github.com/Trunkplatform/lazybones-dropwizard-turbo)
  * [Tutum Zero Downtime Deploy gem](https://github.com/Trunkplatform/tutum-deploy)

  and actively contributes to the following:

Source code and Stack (Docker Compose) for this blog is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/yunspace/yunspace.com).
