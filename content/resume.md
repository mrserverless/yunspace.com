 A hands-on, business-oriented leader driven by a strong desire to drive enterprises to accelerate the only metric that matters in the digital era: __time to value__. Through the human-centric and strategic use of modern technology and processes.

By harnessing global enterprise expertise, Harvard insights, solid management consulting principles with software engineering principles, I have perfected a unique end to end transformation methodology from business outcomes to delivering excellence. In two decades, this approach has been successfully validated across multiple enterprises, government and startups.
